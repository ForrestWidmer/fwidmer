    <p>Good web applications solve problems. I used to struggle with A.D.D and I know many people who still struggle with it to this day. I know first hand the frustration this condition can cause in everyday life and it's a problem. That was my inspiration for building ForgetMeNot!, to help those who are struggling with a condition similar to A.D.D/A.D.H.D. With this application, users can create a free account and pre schedule reminder text messages to be delivered at a set day/time. The text reminders can be for anything! Paying bills on time, important dates like birthdays/anniversaries, or for changes in your regular schedule.</p>

    <p>This is a community based SaaS web application. The purpose of this app is to allow users to build, share, and customize wiki's using markdown syntax for formatting. A free user can create an account and start building an unlimited amount of free public wiki's that anyone can view. Free users have the option to pay a small fee to become a premium member. Premium members have the ability to privatize their wikiâ€™s so that the public cannot view it. They also have the ability to add an unlimited amount of collaborators to their various projects with each collaborator having the ability to be assigned one of several roles.</b></p>
