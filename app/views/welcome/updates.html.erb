    <p>This is a community based SaaS web application. The purpose of this app is to allow users to build, share, and customize wiki's using markdown syntax for formatting. A free user can create an account and start building an unlimited amount of free public wiki's that anyone can view. Free users have the option to pay a small fee to become a premium member. Premium members have the ability to privatize their wikiâ€™s so that the public cannot view it. They also have the ability to add an unlimited amount of collaborators to their various projects with each collaborator having the ability to be assigned one of several roles.</b></p>
